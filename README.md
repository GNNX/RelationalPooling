# Deep Relational Pooling

## Overview
This is the code associated with the paper _Deep Relational Pooling_. 

Our first task evaluates RP-GIN, a powerful model we propose to make Graph Isomorphism Network of [Xu et. al. 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00826) more powerful than its corresponding WL[1] test.   
Our second set of tasks uses molecule datasets to evaluate different instantiations of RP.

## Requirements
* [PyTorch](https://www.pytorch.org)
* Python 3

For the synthetic tasks, you will need
* SciPy
* scikit-learn
* docopt and schema for parsing arguments from command line

For the molecular tasks, you will need
* [DeepChem](https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem) and its associated dependencies

## How to Run
* An example call for the synthetic tasks follows.  We trained these models on CPUs.  Please see the docstring for further details
```
python Run_Gin_Experiment.py --cv-fold 0 --num-epochs 12 --out-weight-dir /scratch-data/murph213/
```
* IPython Notebooks are provided for the molecule tasks and can be run individually. Minor changes are required to run the tasks for a different dataset: this can be done by changing the 'TASK' macro variable to the dataset of choice.

## Data
* The datasets for the first set of tasks are available in the Synthetic_Data directory.
* The datasets for the molecular tasks are all available in the DeepChem package.
