# Relational Pooling

## Overview
This is the code associated with the paper [Relational Pooling for Graph Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02541). 

Our first task evaluates RP-GIN, a powerful model we propose to make Graph Isomorphism Network of [Xu et. al. 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00826) more powerful than its corresponding WL[1] test.   
Our second set of tasks uses molecule datasets to evaluate different instantiations of RP.

## Requirements
* [PyTorch](https://www.pytorch.org)
* Python 3

For the synthetic tasks, you will need
* SciPy
* scikit-learn
* docopt and schema for parsing arguments from command line

For the molecular tasks, you will need
* [DeepChem](https://github.com/deepchem/deepchem) and its associated dependencies

## Examples: How to Run
* An example call for the synthetic tasks follows.  We trained these models on CPUs.  Please see the docstring for further details
```
python Run_Gin_Experiment.py --cv-fold 0 --num-epochs 12 --out-weight-dir /scratch-data/murph213/
```
* Now we show examples for the molecular tasks.  The Tox 21 dataset is smaller so we demonstrate with that.
For the molecular k-ary tasks:
```
python Duvenaud-kary.py 'tox_21' 20
```
* For the molecular RP-Duvenaud tasks:
```
python rp_duvenaud.py 'tox_21' 'unique_local' 0
```
* For the molecular RNN task:
```
python RNN-DFS.py 'tox_21'
```

## Data
* The datasets for the first set of tasks are available in the Synthetic_Data directory.
* The datasets for the molecular tasks are all available in the DeepChem package.
